### Feedback

I am very grateful for the wonderful and engaging challenge that helped me refresh my knowledge in building API services, using Docker, and gRPC. Due to a lack of free time, I couldn't focus on covering unit tests for infrastructure components, so I concentrated on testing only the business logic. 
I would appreciate any your comments or feedback.
